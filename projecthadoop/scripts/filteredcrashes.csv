01/08/2001,,Near Silimo Indonesia,Military - Tentara Nasional Indonesia Navy,Timika - Jayapura,CASA 212-MP Aviocar 200,9,9,Struck Timika Peak at 11800 ft. shortly after taking off.
01/04/2001,,Zheng Zou AB China,Military - People's Liberation Army,Training,Shaanxi Yunshuji Y-8/Yunshuji Y-8,16,16,Two Antonov 12 planes collided in midair killing all aboard and 6 on the ground.
04/05/2000,09:30,Marianna Florida,Bankair,Opa-Locka - Marianna,Learjet 35A,3,3,While on finals the training flight pitched up the right wing dropped and the airplane struck trees struck wires caught fire on a road. The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane while on final approach resulting in the airplane striking trees. Factors in this accident were: improper planning of the approach and not obtaining the proper alignment with the runway.
04/19/2000,,Bukavu DemocratiRepubliCongo,Kivu Air Services,,Cessna 208B Caravan I,2,2,The charter flight crashed in the Kahuzi-Biega National Park.
01/05/2000,,Abuja Nigeria,Skypower Express Airways,Lagos - Abuja,Embraer 110P1A Bandeirante,16,1,During a visual approach the aircraft stalled and pancaked 400 ft. short of the runway.
01/10/2000,17:54,Niederhasli Switzerland,Crossair,Zürich - Dresden,Saab 340B,10,10,The aircraft crashed shortly after taking off 8 km from the airport in light rain. After departing the captain turned the aircraft to the right instead of to the left. The first officer advised the captain he should be turning right and ATC also asked about the direction taken. ATC then cleared the aircraft for a right turn. Soon after the pitch decreased rapidly accompanied by a marked speed increase and plane entered a high speed high-rate spiral descent and crashed into an open field. The flight crew reacted inappropriately to the change in departure clearance SID ZUE 1Y by ATC. The first officer made an entry in the FMS without being instructed to do so by the commander which related to the change to the SID ZUE 1 standard instrument departure. In doing so he omitted to select a turn direction. The captain dispensed with use of the autopilot under instrument flight conditions and during the work-intensive climb phase of the flight. The captain took the aircraft into a spiral dive to the right because with a probability bordering on certainty he had lost spatial orientation. The first officer took only inadequate measures to prevent or recover from the spiral dive.
01/13/2000,12:38,Off Marsa el-Brega Libya,Avisto,Tripoli IAP - Marsa el-Brega,Shorts 360-300,41,22,The aircraft was on a flight from Tripoli to Marsa el-Brega Libya ferrying oil workers. As the twin engine plane approached Marsa El-Brega the crew experienced a double engine failure and ditched into the sea. Failure of the crew to use the anti-icing system which led to the ingestion of melting ice into both engines causing failure of both engines.
01/15/2000,13:10,San Jose Costa Rica,TACA,San Jose - Tortuguero,Let 410UVP-E,20,5,The aircraft was not able to maintain altitude after taking off and crashed into a house.

01/25/2000,18:09,Near Ankara Turkey,Top Air - Air Taxi,Ankara - Istanbul,Beechcraft King Air C90,4,4,The aircraft crashed near a pond 25 km from Cubuk 20 minutes after taking off. Failure to use de-icing and poor weather was to blame.
01/30/2000,21:08,Off Abidjan Ivory Coast,Kenya Airways,Abidjan - Lagos,AirbusA310-304,179,169,The aircraft crashed into the AtlantiOcean three minutes after taking off from Felix Houphouet-Boigny Airport.  A few seconds after lifting off the ground the stall warning sounded and continued for about 20 seconds until it was manually turned off by the crew. Three seconds later the plane impacted the water. The pilot's response to an alarm that inaccurately indicated the plane had stalled. The pilot failed to complete established procedure for such an emergency. Takeoff conditions also contributed to the accident which occurred at night hampering the crew's ability to judge the plane's distance from the sea.
04/19/2000,,Pepa Congo,Military - Centrafricain Airlines,Pepa Congo - Kigali Rwanda,Antonov AN-8,24,24,The military flight crashed after losing its engines after striking birdsunable to return to land.
07/02/2000,10:50,Off Cagayancillo Philippines,Military - Philippine Air Force,Cagayancillo - Puerto Princesa,GAF Nomad N-22C,15,14,Engine problems forced the pilot to return to the airport. However he overshot the runway and crashed into the sea. One passenger was rescued by fishermen. Major General Santiago Madrid chief of the southwestern military command killed.
01/31/2000,16:21,Off Point Mugu California,Alaska Airlines,Puerto Vallarta - San Francisco,McDonnell Douglas MD-83,88,88,The aircraft crashed into the PacifiOcean south of Point Mugu in 650 ft. feet of water while en route from Puerto Vallarta to San Francisco. Radio transmissions from the plane indicated the pilots were struggling with a jammed stabilizer for the last 11 minutes of the flight before nose-diving into the sea. While preparing to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport control was lost and the MD-83 was seen in a nose-down attitude spinning and tumbling in a continuous roll inverted before it impacted the sea.  Loss of airplane pitch control resulting from in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assembly's acme nut thread. The component failed because of excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines' insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska Airlines' extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation Administration's approval of that extension which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads and Alaska Airlines' extended end play check interval and the FAA's approval of that extension which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophieffects of total acme nut thread loss. Cynthia Oti radio financial talk show host Dean Forshee guitarist Jean Gandesberry columnist Tom Stockley columnist were among those killed.
02/02/2000,,Tehran Iran,Military - IslamiRepubliof Iran Air Force,Training,Lockheed C-130 Hercules,8,8,Crashed on take off.

The pilot's attempted flight into adverse weather and his failure to maintain altitude/clearance above the snow-covered tundra. Factors associated with the accident were snow rain and whiteout conditions.
02/16/2000,19:50,Sacramento California,Emery Worldwide,Sacramento CA - Dayton OH,McDonnell Douglas DC-8-71F,3,3,The cargo plane lost altitude after taking off and crashed into a auto salvage yard and burned. A loss of pitch control resulting from the disconnection of the right elevator control tab. The disconnection was caused by the failure to properly secure and inspect the attachment bolt.
03/05/2000,18:11,Burbank Calilfornia,Southwest Airlines,Las Vegas - Burbank,Boeing B-737-3T5,142,0,While attempting to land at Burbank Airport the plane overran the runway collided with a metal blast fence and an airport perimeter wall and came to rest on a city street near a gas station. The plane touched down at 182 knots 2150 feet past the runway threshold too fast and too far down the runway for the plane to stop in time.  In the accident sequence  the nose gear collapsed the forward service door (1R) escape slide inflated inside the airplane and  the forward dual flight attendant jumpseat which was occupied by two flight attendants partially collapsed. Two passengers sustained serious injuries and 41 passengers and the captain sustained minor injuries. The flightcrew's excessive airspeed and flight path angle during the approach and landing and its failure to abort the approach when stabilized approach criteria were not met. Contributing to the accident was the controller's positioning of the airplane in such a manner as to leave no safe options for the flightcrew other than a go-around maneuver.
03/09/2000,08:40,Moscow Russia,Vologodskiye Airlines,Moscow - Kiev,Yakovlev YAK-40,9,9,The aircraft climbed to an altitude of about 100 ft. stalled lost control and crashed. Ice build up on the wings. Flaps incorrectly set.

The plane aborted a previous landing attempt because another plane was on the runway. Weather and visibility were good in the area but the landing attempt may have been hampered by low-lying clouds. The last message from the crew was that they were 7 miles from the airport on final approach. Nothing more was heard from the plane. The aircraft disintegrated upon impact near Mt. Kalangan. The elevation of the accident site was about 500 feet above sea level but the plane should have been at a altitude of 1500 feet.
04/29/2000,,Bapi Papua New Guinea,North Coast Aviation,,Britten-Norman BN-2A-20 Islander,4,4,
05/02/2000,14:39,Lyon Satolas France,Northern Executive Aviation,,Learjet 35A,5,2,During a landing attempt the crew shut down No. 1 engine and declared an emergency. The plane was told to divert to Lyon Satolas. Power was applied to the remaining engine and the plane banked to the left causing the wing to touch the ground crash and catch fire. Loss of yaw and roll control which appears to be due to the failure to monitor flight symmetry at the time of the thrust increase on the right engine.
05/03/2000,,Kurupung Guyana,Trans Guyana Airways,,Britten-Norman BN-2A-9 Islander,1,1,The cargo plane crashed into a cloud covered mountain.
05/10/2000,20:30,Kaunakakai Hawaii,Price Aircraft Company,Kahului - Hoolehua,Rockwell Sabreliner 65,6,6,While on approach the charter flight hit the ridge of a mountain. Inadequate crew coordination led to the captain's decision to discontinue the instrument approach procedure and initiate a maneuvering descent solely by visual references at night in an area of mountainous terrain. The crew failed to review the instrument approach procedure and the copilot failed to provide accurate information regarding terrain clearance and let down procedures during the instrument approach.
05/17/2000,09:47,Moanda Gabon,Avirex,Libreville - Moanda,Beechcraft 1900C-1,10,3,The charter flight crashed while on approach in fog and mist.
05/21/2000,11:28,Near Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania,Executive Airlines,AtlantiCity - Wilkes-Barre,BAe Jetstream 3101-31,19,19,The plane crashed into a heavily wood area  as it was making a second approach to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport. Visibility was poor in wind low clouds and light rain.  While attempting the second approach the pilot reported both engines had quit but restarted one of them before the plane crashed. Investigation revealed indications of rotation on the left engine at the time of impact but the power level was not known. The right engine and propellers exhibited little or no rotation at the time of impact. Failure of the crew to ensure an adequate supply of fuel for the flight which led to the stoppage of the right engine due to fuel exhaustion and the intermittent stoppage of the left engine.  Failure of the crew to monitor the plane's fuel state and the flightcrews failure to maintain directional control after the initial stoppage.
05/25/2000,,Near Manila Philippines,Philippine Air Lines,Davao - Manila,Airbus A.330-301,298,1,A hijacker robbed passengers jumped out of the plane with a homemade parachute and was killed in the jump.

The pilot's continued VFR flight into IMC conditions by failing to maintain altitude and descending from VFR conditions into IMC which resulted in him subsequently impacting with trees. Factors in this accident were: reduced visibility due to dark night and fog. An additional factor was the pilot was not certified for instrument flight.
07/17/2000,07:34,Patna India,Indian Airlines/Alliance Airlines,Calcutta - Patna - Lucknow - New Delhi,Boeing B-737-2A8 Advanced,58,55,While attempting to land at Patna the aircraft was too high and the crew attempted a go-around. During the second landing attempt the aircraft was again high veered to left and lost altitude until it crashed into houses in the Gardanibagh district and burst into flames. The cause of the accident was loss of control of the aircraft due to crew error. The crew did not followed the correct approach procedure which resulted in the aircraft being high on approach. The crew then initiated a 'go-around procedure' instead of an 'approach to stall recovery procedure' resulting in an actual stall of the aircraft loss of control and subsequent impact with the ground.
07/19/2000,00:30,Linneus Maine,Airwave Transport,Moncton - Montreal,Grumman G-159 Gulfstream I,2,2,After declaring an emergency the cargo plane crew requested the nearest airport. The aircraft soon after descended out of control and crashed on the eastern side of the Meduxnekeag River. The pilot-in-command's failure to maintain minimum control airspeed which resulted in a loss of control. Factors in this accident were clouds and a loss of engine power for undetermined reasons while in cruise flight above the airplane's single engine service ceiling.
07/20/2000,13:12,Nassau Bahamas,Allied Air Freight,,Douglas C-47A-10-DK,2,2,The cargo plane lost an engine on takeoff lost altitude and crashed 2 miles east of the airport.

07/25/2000,16:44,Gonesse France,Air France,Paris - New York City,Aerospatiale BAe Concorde 101,109,109,The aircraft struggled to gain altitude after taking off from Charles de Gaulle airport. The pilot reported the No. 2 engine failed and struggled to steer towards Le Bourget airfield as smoke and fire trailed the jet's left wing.   The plane was unable to gain altitude went nose high stalled and crashed into a small hotel complex.  A metal strip left on the runway by another plane gashed one of the Concorde's tires which blew out sending a piece of rubber into the underside of the wing which sent a shockwave which ruptured a seam in the fuel tank. An electrical severed by another piece of rubber sparked which ignited leaking fuel ignited and started an uncontrollable fire. Power was lost to the No. 1 and No. 2 engines which led to loss of control of the aircraft and subsequent crash. Investigation revealed the metal strip was probably a thrust reverser part from Continental Airlines DC-10-30  registered N13067 which departed Paris as Flight 055 to Newark. This is the first crash of a Concorde in aviation history.
07/26/2000,,Mafraq Jordan,Military - Royal Jordanian Air Force,,Lockheed C-130H Hercules,13,13,Crashed on a training flight.

The Navajo had taken off from Lakehurst Naval Air Station and the Seminole from Northeast Philadelphia Airport.  The Navajo crashed into a two-story house while the Seminole fell into a soybean field. Two pilots and seven passenger were killed on the Navajo as were a pilot instructor and his student on the Seminole. Failure of the pilots of the two airplanes to see and avoid each other and maintain proper airspace separation during visual flight rules.
08/12/2000,,Near Tshikapa Congo,Staer Air,Kinshasa - Tshikapa,Antonov AN-26B,27,27,The plane was approaching Tshikapa and the pilot informed the tower that it was having difficulties with its landing gear. The tower told the pilot to do a low fly-by for an evaluation and then make an emergency landing but the pilot refused and attempted to return to Kinshasa. The plane crashed 40 miles north of Tshikapa.
08/14/2000,23:57,Teslin Lake British Columbia Canada,RCMP-GRC Air Services,Teslin - Dease Lake,Cessna 208 Caravan I,2,2,The float plane took off entered a steep climb stalled and crashed into the water. The pilot's decision to depart from the unlit location was likely the result of the many psychological and physiological stressors encountered during the day. The pilot most likely experienced spatial disorientation precipitated by local geographiand environmental conditions and lost control of the aircraft.
08/15/2000,08:25,Lumber City Georgia,Air Taxi,Dothan AL - Hazelhurst GA,Piper PA-31-350,3,3,While on approach the airplane collided with trees and the ground and subsequently burst into flames.

08/23/2000,19:30,Off Manama Bahrain,Gulf Air,Cairo - Manama,Airbus A320-212,143,143,The aircraft crashed into the Persian Gulf and exploded in flames while attempting to land at Bahrain International Airport. The crew decided to perform a missed approach after it was determined the aircraft was coming in too high and fast. Instructions were given for a 180 degree turn and climb to 2500 feet. While performing the missed approach the plane suddenly descended rapidly from an altitude of 1000 feet and crashed into the shallow waters of the gulf approximately 1 mile from the airport. The accident was a result of a fatal combination of factors including the captain's failure to comply with standard operating procedures and the copilot's actions in not drawing the captain's attention to the deviations of the aircraft from the standard flight parameters. The captain may have suffered a 'spatial disorientation' to ground warning systems which could have made him falsely perceive the aircraft was pitching up. He responded by making a nose down input resulting in the aircraft starting to descend when aircraft warning systems were saying he should increase altitude.
08/25/2000,17:30,Hilo Bay Hawaii,Big Island Airlines,Sightseeing,Piper PA-31-350 Navajo Chieftain,9,1,The aircraft was on an around-the-island tour when it's right engine caught fire. While attempting an emergency landing at Hilo International Airport the plane ditched into Hilo Bay. Eight people escaped from the plane before it sank in 100 feet of water. One passenger was not able to exit the plane and drowned. Possible failure of the turbo unit on the right engine.
08/26/2000,12:10,Near La Fortuna Costa Rica,SANSA,San Jose  - La Fortuna - Tamarindo,Cessna 208B Grand Caravan I,10,10,The plane crashed head-on into 5360 ft. Arenal volcano 95 miles north of San Jose shortly after taking off from La Fortuna. The pilot was flying VFR and deviated from his course by 12 miles most likely to give passengers a view of the volcano which had erupted earlier in the week. The reason the crew did not see the volcano is not known. Possibly with changing meteorological conditions in the area the volcano may have been obscured by clouds. The plane built in 1998 had been leased from Aeroperlas.
09/02/2000,,Mount Montezuma Colombia,Military - Fuerza Aérea Colombiana,,Douglas C-47,7,7,Flew into Mt. Montezuma.
09/04/2000,15:10,Near Burketown Australia,Charter - Central Air,Perth - ,Beechcraft SKA 200,8,8,Shortly after departing Perth and after the aircraft had climbed through its assigned altitude the pilot’s speech became significantly impaired and he appeared unable to respond to ATS instructions. Open microphone transmissions over the next 8-minutes revealed the progressive deterioration of the pilot towards unconsciousness and the absence of any sounds of passenger activity in the aircraft. No human response of any kind was detected for the remainder of the flight. Five hours after taking off from Perth the aircraft impacted the ground 65 km ESE of Burketown Queensland and was destroyed. Incapacitation of the pilot and passengers a result of hypobarihypoxia due to the aircraft being fully or partially unpressurised and their not receiving supplemental oxygen. The investigation could not determine the reason for the aircraft being unpressurised or why the pilot and passengers did not receive supplemental oxygen.
09/16/2000,09:25,Kumarapura Sri Lanka,Military - Sri Lanka Air Force,Colombo - Kalmunai,Mil Mi-17,14,14,The Air Force helicopter was on a domestiflight when it cashed into mountainous terrain 75 km from Colombo.

09/18/2000,15:10,Nuiqsut Alaska,Cape Smythe Air Service,Deadhorse - Nuiqsut,Piper PA-31-350 Navajo,10,5,The belly cargo pod  lightly scraped the runway for about 40 feet but the airplane transitioned to a climb. As the airplane began climbing away from the runway the landing gear was observed to extend. The airplane climbed to about 100 to 150 feet above the ground and then began a descending left turn. The airplane collided with the ground on a 095 degree heading. The wreckage path extended for about 300 feet during which the landing gear left wing and the left engine separated from the airplane. A postcrash fire destroyed the fuselage right wing and the right engine. The pilot's failure to extend the landing gear his improper aborted landing procedure and inadvertent stall/mush. Factors in the accident were an improper adjustment of the landing gear warning horn system by company maintenance personnel and the failure of the pilot to utilize the prelanding checklist.
10/06/2000,16:55,Reynosa Mexico,Aeromexico,Mexico City - Reynosa - Matamoros,McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31,88,0,The aircraft overshot the runway near Reynosa Mexico and crashed into vehicles and houses coming to rest in a canal.

Several tires blew out causing a fire which was quickly extinguished by emergency crews.  Eleven passengers were slightly injured. The leak was caused by a damaged fuel feed pipe that was caused by interference from the aft hydraulipump. Mechanics did not completely follow a Rolls-Royce service bulletin. In addition software mistakenly identified the  fuel leak as a fuel imbalance prompting the crew to respond erroneously to the situation. The official report stated the cause was the pilots responded incorrectly to the fuel leak.  The pilots acted from memory rather than utilizing a checklist so they never saw a 'Caution' note in the Fuel Imbalance checklist that might have caused them to consider that the real problem was not an imbalance but a fuel leak.

The weather was clear and windy at the time of the accident. An in-flight loss of control resulting from upper surface ice contamination that the pilot-in-command failed to detect during his preflight inspection of the airplane. Contributing to the accident was the lack of a preflight inspection requirement for CE-208 pilots to examine at close range the upper surface of the wing for ice contamination when ground icing conditions exist.
10/10/2001,10:42,Off Valencia Spain,Flightline,Barcelona - Oran Algeria,Swearingen SA-226AT Merlin IV,10,10,The plane was en-route from Barcelona Spain to Oran Algeria 80 miles off the coast of Valencia Spain when it informed Valencia ATC it was going to change course in order to avoid bad weather.

Factors include falling snow low ceilings whiteout/greyout conditions and flat/glassy water.
11/12/2001,09:16,Belle Harbor Queens New York,American Airlines,New York City - Santo Domingo Dominican Rep.,Airbus A-300-605R,260,260,Three minutes after taking off and while in a climbing left turn at 2800 ft. parts of the plane including the vertical stabilizer and rudder fell from the aircraft. The crew soon lost control of the plane which nose dived and crashed into a residential neighborhood. After flying into the wake turbulence of two aircraft about two minutes into the flight investigators believe a series of quick rudder swings by the copilot whipped the tail so severely that the fin broke off. The National Transportation Safety Board has found that pilot error was the probable cause. Sharply criticizing American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program the Board said that American Airlines' pilot training included a simulator exercise which could have caused the first officer to have an unrealistiand exaggerated view of the effects of wake turbulence erroneously associate wake turbulence encounters with the need for aggressive roll upset recovery techniques and develop control strategies that would produce a much different -- and potentially surprising and confusing -- response if performed during flight. In addition because of its high sensitivity the Airbus A-300-600 rudder control system is susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeed.

Debris was spread across a 20 mile radius. Fifty-two children on a beach holiday were among the 69 aboard the Tupolev. The Tupolev pilot received contradictory instructions. The collision avoidance warning system (TCAS) told the pilot to ascend followed by an order from the Swiss air trafficontroller to descend one second later. The Russian plane did not immediately respond to the tower's order to descend so he repeated the command 14 seconds later. Thirty seconds later the two planes collided. The Tupolev's TCAS was telling the pilots to ascend. The Boeing's TCAS was telling the pilots to descend. The Swiss air trafficontroller was telling the Tupolev's pilots to descend. The air trafficontroller that guided the planes had no way of knowing the Russian pilot was receiving contradictory instruction from his cockpit TCAS unless told so by the pilot. Russian aviation officials said the pilot correctly gave precedence to the control tower but Western aviation experts said pilots are trained to give precedence to the cockpit warning. In addition the controller was left alone on duty while his partner went on a break and was preoccupied with another aircraft. This was accepted policy at Skyguide the Swiss air control company. In addition maintenance crews working on the computer system limited the controller's information he was receiving including conflict alert warnings. Sadly one-and-a-half years later the controller Peter Nielsen was stabbed to death by a Russian man who had lost his wife and two children in the accident.

The plane clipped tree tops before crashing on its belly into a wooded area. Data show the plane descending then climbing slightly in the last four seconds before impact. The plane lacked a modern terrain warning system which would have been required equipment the next year. The pilots' failure to follow established procedures and properly conduct a nonprecision instrument approach at night in instrument meteorological conditions including their descent below the minimum descent altitude before required visual cues were available (which continued unmoderated until the airplane struck the trees) and their failure to adhere to the established division of duties between the flying and nonflying pilots. Contributing to the accident were the pilots' failure to make standard callouts and the current Federal Aviation Regulations that allow pilots to descend below the MDA into a region in which safe obstacle clearance is not assured based upon seeing the airport approach lights. The pilots' failure to establish and maintain a professional demeanor during the flight and their fatigue likely contributed to their degraded performance.

Dark night visual conditions prevailed. The controller's Minimum Safe Altitude Warning System issued and alert during the last two radar returns. The air trafficontroller failed to alert the crew to altitude warnings as the plane was on track to fly into a mountain. The controller identified the airplane on the radar screen and instructed crew members to expect clearance above 5000 feet but then issued a heading that resulted in a flight track directly into the mountains. The mountain is at 3556 feet altitude. Also the flight crew did not follow the recommended departure procedures for taking off at night and in mountainous terrain. Failure of the flightcrew to maintain terrain clearance during a VFR departure which resulted in controlled flight into terrain and the air trafficontroller's issuance of a clearance that transferred the responsibility for terrain clearance from the fllightcrew to the controller. The controller's failure to provide terrain clearance instructions to the flightcrew and failure to advise the flightcrew of minimum safe altitude warning alerts. Contributing to the accident was the pilots' fatigue which likely contributed to their degraded decision making.

There was light snow falling with fog and reduced visibility at the time of the accident.  Also the pilot chose to take off from a 7500 ft. runway rather than wait for the 10000 ft. runway to be plowed. The youngest son of NBC sports chairman Dick Ebersol and actress Susan Saint James killed. St. James had just exited the accident vehicle before it took off. The flightcrew's failure to ensure that the airplane's wings were free of ice or snow contamination that accumulated while the airplane was on the ground which resulted in an attempted takeoff with upper wing contamination that induced the a subsequent stall and collision with the ground. A factor contributing to the accident was the pilots' lack of experience flying during winter weather conditions.
